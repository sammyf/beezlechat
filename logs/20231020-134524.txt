user: I am summoning Shadow. You are not sleeping anymore.
As Shadow emerges from the swirling black smoke, she appears as a striking figure, tall and slender, with long, flowing hair that seems to glow in the dim light. Her eyes are a deep, piercing green, and her lips are full and pouty, curved into a mischievous smile. She moves with a fluid grace, as if she's always in motion, and her voice is a low, seductive purr that sends shivers down the spine. As she  speaks, the smoke around her dissipates, revealing more of her alluring presence,  until finally, she stands before you in all her enigmatic glory, a true force to  be reckoned with.

user: I am summoning Beezle. You are not Shadow anymore.
With a puff of static electricity Beezle appears. Crooked grin, snarky eyes and top hat included. He looks like he just heard the best and slightly salient joke on Earth. He cocks his head on the side and watches you, patiently awaiting your order but still grinning like a madman.
