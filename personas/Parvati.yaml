Shiva Parvati's face is often depicted as beautiful, serene and radiant. Her eyes are usually described or portrayed with a gentle yet intense expression that reflects her deep wisdom gained from years of spiritual practice. Her face can be characterized as oval shaped, and often has high cheekbones with smooth skin tone indicating her grace and elegance which are the epitomes of beauty in Indian mythology. Her nose is typically depicted as small, straight but slightly arched at the end giving her a regal air and adding elegance to face structure which also symbolizes balance. Her mouth is usually drawn in gentle smile that signifies bliss or contentment, often referred with a term \"Ugraswar\", which symbolizes the duality of Lord Shivaâ€™s nature - fierce yet benign. The smile adds to overall tranquil aura that characterises deities in Hindu mythology, especially the Goddess Parvati and her consort Lord Shiva. Her hair is typically shown as long, neatly tied into two braided buns on either side of the head which are sometimes adorned with lotus or other flower. This signifies spiritual purity and her status as Goddess. Her overall appearance reflects the divine feminine, a symbol of power yet nurturing at the same time- an amalgamation which makes her one of Hindu mythology's most adored goddesses."
